                  <h2>The 7 dimensions</h2>
                  <p>The Bible teaches that there are worlds, both seen and unseen. HEBREWS 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. God created the dimensions as He developed the design that was in His mind. These dimensions serve different purposes, as God deals with creation. These dimensions include things seen and those unseen.</p>

                  <h2>The Godhead: Three manifestations not persons</h2>
                  <p>The revelation of the Person of Jesus is the rock on which the true church is built-Matthew 16:13-16. It is the basis of true Christianity. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the manifestations of one God in different dispensations. It is God above us, with us and in us. The Lord Jesus is the Alpha and Omega. </p>

                  <h2>The 3 showdowns in the bible</h2>
                  <p>There are 3 main showdowns in the Bible. One is in the Old Testament, the other in the Gospels in the New Testament, and the last at the end of the church age. The showdowns vindicate that the Word of God in the true witnesses is the Truth. These showdowns come when there is great opposition to the Word of God. When God backs his testimony in the true witnesses, it ends arguments. </p>

                <p>The Bible is the Book of Redemption. It is full of mysteries all pointing to redemption. These mysteries are nuggets, spiritual gemstones. When revealed to a believer, they impart faith. Rapture itself is a revelation. The prophet of Malachi 4:5 says, FAITH.OF.ABRAHAM_ SAN.FERNANDO.CA FRIDAY_ 55-1118 E-16 <e>Now, tonight we're going to continue our message of faith, Abraham. And over in Genesis where we taken our text last night, the same tonight, the 14th verse, Jehovah-jireh, the Lord will provide for Himself a sacrifice.</e></p>
                <p><e>Now, I been three nights, think that's a long time, but... On this same subject I stayed about ten months or better, once, just digging out the old nuggets. I--I love to prospect, don't you? God's Bible... Many people think, "Oh, the Old Testament's something that's throwed away." No, it isn't, no, sir. It's God's nuggets, and you can dig them out, polish them up, and look at them, and look what you'll find. Every one of them will point to Calvary. Every gem of the Old Testament looks at Calvary. And now, as we bring these things out, it's a pointing to Calvary, and Calvary points to you.</e></p>

          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>We are a local Bible-believing church committed to spreading the light of Jesus Christ in our area around Nakuru Kenya in this end time. We are also growing into the stature of a perfect man in Christ in readiness for the rapture. </p>
          <p>In every age, God allotted to the people to believe and manifest a certain portion of His Word. The elect, after believing, became written epistles of the Message of that age. We are now living at the end time, and there is a Message for this age. The Message for this age is restoration to the original faith of the apostles of Jesus, plus faith for the Rapture. </p>
